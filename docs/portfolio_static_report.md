| Best year (return) | 2013 · 70.2% |

> **Read this first:** The strategy has delivered strong gains overall, but the trade-off is meaningful drawdowns in crisis periods (e.g., 2020). Pair the headline numbers with the drawdown profile before assuming similar comfort going forward.

## How to Use This Snapshot

1. **Set expectations** – Use the average and median returns as a base case, but budget for at least a -35% peak-to-trough hit.
2. **Assess consistency** – Prioritize the Sharpe ratio trend when comparing to alternatives; 2013 and 2019 show the attainable upper bound.
3. **Plan for stress** – 2018 and 2020 offer realistic worst-case scenarios for losses and volatility spikes. Ensure capital allocation can withstand them.
